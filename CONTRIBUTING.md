# Contributing to LövePotion

Anyone can contribute to LövePotion, but there are a few guidelines.

 * Tabs for indentation, spaces are **the devil!**
 * No Allman style brackets please, they're ugly.
 * If you add an external library, please add the respective license to the license folder.
 * Accurately test your changes, if it's a change that improves performance for example, *make sure it actually improves performance!*
 * Codebase cleanups are very welcome, things are a mess right now.

That's all mostly, if you have any questions hit me up on `#lovepotion` on OFTC.
