# FAQ

* **Can I run my LÖVE game on this?**

Right now? Very unlikely. A lot of the API hasn't been implemented yet.

If you want to try, place your games files in a folder the game folder that comes with LövePotion.

* **Can I help?**

Yes, I need all the help I can get. I am new to C, so my code will probably be quite messy, and I don't have the talent that a lot of other people have. 

Just send in a pull request and I'll look over it.

* **How do I build this?**

I don't recommend building this yourself right now, instead just ask me for a build.

* **How do I run this?**

There are ~~2 ways~~ a ton of ways to run this.
 * [Citra Emulator](http://citra-emu.org)
 * [Ninjhax](smealum.net/ninjhax)
 * [IronHax](http://smealum.github.io/3ds)
 * [TubeHax](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/)

**LövePotion** is developed using [Citra](http://citra-emu.org/) and [IronHax](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/).

* **Neat! I'm gonna send my game to Nintendo and get cartridge of my game and I'l-**

Stop right there kiddo, this is for Homebrew only.

This is not for releasing a real 3DS title. I dunno, contact Nintendo if thats what you want.
