**LövePotion** is an unofficial work in progress implementation of the [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/) API for 3DS Homebrew.

The dream is to be able to run Love2D games on 3DS, but at its current stage all it can really do is draw primative shapes.


# FAQ

* **Can I run my Love2D game on this?**

Right now? Very unlikely. A lot of the API hasn't been implimented yet.

If you want to try, place your games files in a folder called LovePotion on your SD Card.

* **Can I help?**

Yes, I need all the help I can get. I am new to C, so my code will probably be quite messy, and I don't have the talent that a lot of other people have. 

Just fork the project and send in a pull request and I'll look over it.

* **How do I build this?**

Follow the instructions [here](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment) then run make. I recommend you do it on Linux.

* **How do I run this?**

There are 2 ways to run this, and thats by either using the [Citra](http://citra-emu.org) emulator or running it on a 3DS with [Ninjhax](smealum.net/ninjhax). 

I do not have a 3DS nor Cubic Ninja to test the second method. 

**LövePotion** is developed using [Citra](http://citra-emu.org/).

* **Neat! I'm gonna send my game to Nintendo and get cartridge of my game and I'l-**

Stop right there kiddo, this is for Homebrew only.

This is not for releasing a real 3DS title. I dunno, contact Nintendo if thats what you want.
